        <u>Russell Bonin – Owner</u><br>
         Russell was first introduced to masonry while he was still in high school. 
        After college he went to work for a local mason contractor and later started his own business. 
        He called it Russell Bonin Masonry. His first full year in business was in 1987. He started out
         small but quickly grew into a full service masonry company. Russell became well known for his expertise 
         in stone work, fireplaces, chimneys, stone walls and patios. Russell is now the pastor of a church in 
         Searsport, Maine and runs the masonry business with his son Dan.

        <u>Dan Bonin – Owner</u><br>

        Dan has been involved in masonry since he was old enough to help his dadon 
        some of the smaller projects. Dan went to college at Bob Jones University in 
        Greenville, SC and graduated in 2012 with a B.S. in General Construction 
        Management. After graduating, he came back to Maine and has been running
        the business full time.
        Along with all of his responsibilities with the masonry business, Dan also is a 
        licensed real estate agent in Maine.
